// classes
// keyword 'public' is a default value - there is no need to write that, but in case we want, we can :)
// if we add a keyword 'private' before class property declaration, it will become unaccessible from outside of that class. 
// as expected, 'readonly' keyword makes a property accessible for read only. it can't be changed outside of the class.
